Ooty

holiday with Family &Friends

Family holidays with family friends are the best! Every year a few close friends with their families make sure we go on a holiday together to a place close by considering travel time, feasibility & keeping in mind convenience for all from our otherwise busy schedules to juggle home, work, schools/college holiday dateâ€™s.

Although we had choices, it largely depends on the availability in the staff exchange program; availability for a group of 14 of us actually helped us decide on the destination â€“ Ooty. For most of us in the group Ooty always fascinated us with the imagination of calm weather, lush green landscape covered with misty hills and freshness in the air. Bookings done and 4-1brs were confirmed and vouchers were ready. We had many conference calls with friends to work around the logistics, how we would travel, deciding on responsibilities (this we do on every holiday so all are equally involved, we also engage the kids as well in the. Finally, we decided to travel by bus this time around so we could all be together not to compromise on having some fun â€œBus timeâ€ singing songs, discussions and sharing life & work experiences. The last stretch of the road from Guddalur to Ooty offers the most breathtaking views. At times the route traverses through the dense pine forests allowing glimpses of sunlight through the trees or at other times it passes through the thick bamboo woods. We reached Ooty, one of the famous tourist places for the honeymooners; the hill station about which we heard since childhood; a shooting spot for so many movies & the â€˜Scotland of the Eastâ€™. Our check-in was in Octâ€™19 and it is the monsoon time. Monsoon brings in a lot of rain in this tourist town. We were booked to stay at Sterling Elk Hill. A perfect resort stay by the hill side, the property overlooks lush tea gardens will leave you mesmerized. The resort has large clean bedrooms with windows opening out on to an expansive manicured garden as well as warm and cozy restaurants. The resort staff ensured that all our needs were taken care of and made our stay relaxed and comfortable. The food was excellent and delectable. Meals were served in the cozy dining area which is great for those special dinner conversations. RC I NEWS LETTER | ISSU E 0 3

Evenings were spent huddled around outside, setting the stage for much merry-making. The property has a central open area where they can organize bonfires on request and depending on occupancy. We ended up spending a lot of time here admiring the hill sides. Views are spectacular; you can see the entire valley from the huge windows at the resort common areas as well as most rooms. We found the service at this place impeccable. Kids had a great time at the children park - on the swings in the play area as well as just running around their well maintained grounds. The hotel property has a vast spread of exquisitely landscaped gardens punctuated with beautiful flower beds. The hotel provides some splendid backdrops for memorable family photographs. A few mornings, on waking up, we saw few ducks and common coots enjoying the early morning drizzle in the hill side from our roomâ€™s window There is much to see and do in Ooty, making it a popular destination for a family holiday. The hill station offers some of the best places for travelers to stay. Ooty resorts are known to nestle within the natural beauty and mountain views with its lush green scenic beauty, lofty mountains, and vast expanse of tea estates is a favored tourist spot. Endowed with a chilly climate, Ooty is an ideal destination for people seeking to while away some time close to nature. A destination amidst tea and coffee plantations, is an ideal holiday destination for the city-weary. Apart from coffee and tea plantations, trees like conifers, eucalyptus, pine and wattle line the hillside and its environs.

Charring Cross is a road junction with markets surrounding, it is the the of Ooty â€Varkisâ€ and homemade chocolates which is a delicacy of this pla colleagues. One can also choose from a range of flavours to buy tea packa
