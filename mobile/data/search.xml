What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 							 - Jonathan Mills

      <![CDATA[Friends, As a bachelor I have been for many holidays with friends or sometimes solo through RCI. But my last vacation was very special as it was a full family vacation for the first-time after my wedding. Post our honeymoon I and Juneda (my wife) were thinking to have a holiday with family as it will be a great thing to do to strengthen the family bonding and have those great moments together. We zeroed down on a destination which is suitable for all age group, where everyone can enjoy. At the same time the destination should not be too far. So anonymously Goa emerged as choice of destination, as per family demand!! We were lucky enough to get the resort of our choice â€œRoyal Goan Beach club at Monterio, North Goa. This holiday was full of fun and family time, especially my nephewâ€™s being in the group, their energy level and curiosity throughout the trip kept all of us on our toes. This break was so important and refreshing with family, I feel the time spent together has brought all of us much closer and created great connection. On that note we have promised each other that every year we should go for at least one full family holiday. Thanks Mohan

WINNERS OF MALDIVES FAM TRIP
Our dream come true, and the colour is blue... Maldives used to be the screen saver on our desktop and we always dreamt of going to there. When the announcement was made that there is a FAM trip competition on the floor, we all saw a great zeal across the floor, which includes the team leaders as well. Everyone wanted to qualify for the trip. Finally our perseverance paid off when we saw the magical ocean with infinite horizon and our dream coming true of being on this lovely island country of Maldives.

LI STE N TO T HE E XP E RT

Kamil is working with RCI for more than 10 years and has a very good knowledge about RCI products. With his experience and product knowledge, he ensures to give the best possible service to members and retain them by setting the right expectation. Also, he says not to overpromise members to get a renewal, instead convince them to use their membership to the fullest by explaining the features and benefits. Here are few tips from him to help his fellow collegues: 1.Always speak about the new affiliations and the best possible way to enjoy the holidays, 2. Educate the members how to use RCI membership. 3. Set the right expectations to the member 4. Ensure members get good service post their renewal (after sales service) 5. Help members to register on RCI website and take them through the online booking process and updates. 6. Inform few details about home resort and inturn how they can benefit from RCI 7. Share work experience and holiday experience in RCI affiliated resorts while offering any holidays to members 8. Do not renew the membership if the members have discontinued/cancelled their timeshare. Renewing such members will lead to member dissatisfaction. 9. Convince member on basis of RCI resorts and not on basis of TBO availability or any other 3rd party services. However, you can let them know that these are add-on options 10. Encourage member to save future weeks with RCI and educate them the priority it provides. Happy Selling Folks!
